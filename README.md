# Chew Devour, a Burger Joint
This little web app based on node, express, mysql, & handlebars. We use some routing and ajax calls for updating records.

#### Just visit the heroku deployment url [here](https://chew-devour.herokuapp.com/)

Once on the url scroll down and see the two columns. These represent two different states for the burgers. One side is 'undevoured' the other is... well.. eaten? Ok, they're devoured.
